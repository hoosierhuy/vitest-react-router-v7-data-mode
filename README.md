# React/TypeScript + TailwindCSS v4.1 + Vite + Vitest + React Router v7 Data Mode utilizing GET and POST routes

## I'm using Biome in this project in lieu of ESLint and Prettier

Did you know that React Router v7 has a data mode that allows you to use GET, POST, as well as other CRUD routes? In this project, I will show you how to use GET and POST routes with React Router v7 data mode for data fetching, without having to use the React useEffect hook, thereby keeping your components clean and focused on rendering the UI. This project is built with React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS v4.1, Vite, Vitest, React Router v7, and the dummyjson free API.
